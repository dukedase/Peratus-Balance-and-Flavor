 pic_age_of_discovery_desc: "Columbus Landing at Guanahani, John Vanderlyn, 1837\n\nEager to establish new trade routes to the lucrative Asian markets, European explorers launched numerous expeditions seeking a way around a hostile Islamic world. Among these and powered by the development of the Caravel, Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias was the first European navigator to round the southern tip of Africa in 1488.\n\nFour years later in 1492, after being denied funding by Portugal, Genoese explorer Christopher Columbus discovered the New World while sailing on behalf of the Spanish crown. Columbus argued that the world was smaller than others believed and that the East Indies could be reached by sailing west into the unknown Atlantic. Instead of Asia, the Spainiards found the Caribbean (which Europe named the West Indies) and soon after, they discovered and colonized two new continents, the Americas.\n\nFor the next century, Spain and Portugal were the only two significant colonial powers, splitting the world between themselves with the Treaty of Tordesillas which assigned most of the Americas (except what would become Brazil) to Spanish rule and most of the rest of the world to Portuguese rule. The Reformation and the increase of maritime strength in the northern Protestant countries such as England and the Dutch Netherlands would see to it that these claims would not be permanent."
 pic_age_of_reformation_desc: "Luther at the Diet of Worms, by Anton von Werner, 1877\n\nStanding in an imperial assembly before emperor Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire, Catholic church officers, and an eager crowd, Martin Luther refused to recant of his writings and placed his hope in God.\n\nThe emperor issued the Edict of Worms, branding Luther a notorious heretic. Fearing for his life, an allied noble hid him away in Wartburg Castle where he began translating the Bible into German. Despite the emperor's ban on Luther's ideas, Protestantism would take over much of the Holy Roman Empire and divide Europe for centuries to come."
 pic_age_of_absolutism_desc: "Charles II, by John Michael Wright, 1676\n\nCharles II was crowned King of England in 1661. His coronation marks the restoration of the monarchy which had been disrupted by the English Civil War fought between the primarily Reformed Protestant Parliamentary forces and the primarily Catholic Royalist forces."
 pic_age_of_revolutions_desc: "Washington Crossing the Delaware, Emanuel Leutze, 1851\n\nAfter months of major defeats to the British, including the loss of New York City, a 44 year old general George Washington of the Continental Army crosses the Delaware River with 2,400 of 5,400 soldiers on Christmas day 1776 to surprise enemy Hessians holding nearby Trenton.\n\nThe move led to a decisive victory which helped mobilize the American revolutionaries who eventually won the American Revolutionary War."
 pic_age_of_imperialism_desc: "The State Entry Into Delhi, Roderick D Mackenzie, 1907\n\nFrom 1858 to 1947, Britian retained control over India, Bengal, and surrounding areas. In the years 1877, 1903, and 1911, three Delhi Durbars (Delhi Court)s took place. The Durbars were imperial style celebrations proclaiming the British royal family to be emperors of India, known also as the British Raj. Originally control was held by the Brisih East India Company, but was transferred to the royal family directly, who celebreated the imperial control with the first Durbar of 1877."
 pic_age_of_industrialization_desc: "BASF Werk Ludwigshafen, Robert Friedrich Stieler, 1881\n\nThe 18th and 19th centuries saw massive technological change which contrasted sharply with the millenia that came before. The advent of factories changed the world and made goods much cheaper and easier to produce, paving the way for the modern world."
