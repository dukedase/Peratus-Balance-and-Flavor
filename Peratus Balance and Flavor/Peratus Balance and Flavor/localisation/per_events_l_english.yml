Scholars in your own court argue that they are mere myths and legends, with some of the more zealous courtiers accusing them of being heathens and heretics! One of the adventurers steps forwards and says "My Lord, my name is Veran.  My team and I have just come from the Scandes, where we have heard many strange tales. The locals, though Christians, claim to have dreams of Thor, an old heathen nordic God. In their dreams Thor is seen wielding his mighty hammer, Mjolnir, as he thrashes giants and commands thunder. This has has occured in every one of their dreams." Veran waits a moment before continuing, "Others claim on cold nights they dream of Ymir, a Giant slain by Odin and his brothers. The Norse Myth claims our Earth is created from Ymir's corpse..." \n \nBefore he can finish his statement, a courtier cuts Veran off and loudly claims, "My Lord, this man is a heathen!  Claims of false gods?  Nothing more than lies!  He should be burned at the stake!" \n \nAfter a brief silence, Veran says, "My Lord, I profess no faith or love for Thor.

One bandit was left without any legs, another was mutilated by a pit trap, and another had his head removed from his body quite viciously by a falling log.  One bandit was even captured, as he simply tripped on a rock and hit his head."

The voices are still heard, and as the team continues onward, they get less and less faint... and the scratching gets louder, and more violent.  In the darkness, they spot a light, glowing a vibrant blue.  Veran orders the team to stop, and the light grows larger.  As time goes on Veran realizes the light and sounds are coming closer until out of the darkness, they strike.  Skeletons and other undead creatures, some corrupted and grotesque, flail violently at Veran.  The soldiers are fortunately able to deal with the assault, but the team are left frightened and confused, and hurry to leave this place..."

You quickly forget what you saw, only remembering that you saw something..."

Temperatures have dropped dramatically, and the team is barely able to stop themselves from freezing.  Feeling even heavier than before, they've been forced to abandon some of their equipment.  They feel drawn to a stone shrine not too far from the cave.  As they head there they report strange sightings.  Tall figures observe them from afar, and as they draw closer to the shrine, the weather gets darker and a storm sets in.  Lightning devastates the snow around them, instantly incinerating it.  The water flows only a small distance before freezing, almost suddenly..."

The Runestone reads 'Strength to you, who wields these gauntlets, from the stars come, for all who you fight, shall perish in the night.'  Veran grabs the gauntlets, and reports immediately feeling strange.  He claims he felt immense strength, but also fear.  The others report he destroyed the shrine and threw the runestone far further than any man is capable.  Eventually Veran removed the gauntlets, and put them in a box.  The team, now finding the figures observing them multiplying, and reporting thunder in the distance approaching them and growing in volume, quickly escape to the cave.  They left this letter and a crate for you, but did not stay..."
